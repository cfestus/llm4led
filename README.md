   cd <repository-directory>

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt.

4. **API Configuration**:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key, that is your GPT-4 API.
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

5. **Usage**:
Once you have completed the setup, run the main script to generate annotations.
